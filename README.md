# Fastest-way-to-sort-a-list
## SF Project 25-26

This is a fun little science project that turns my hobbies into an actual assignment :D (As long as I submit it on time lol)
In this project we ask the obvious question: What is the Fastest algorithm that can be used to sort a list?
You can check out my results throughout repository folders and files.

(I hope this is actually useful to some)
